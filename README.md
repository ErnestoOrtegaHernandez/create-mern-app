# create-mern-app
Creates a fullstack application with a todo app template
This template uses MongoDB/Mongoose ODM for data persistence/querying, Express Framework on Node.js backend, and React frontend.
I've also included tailwind config to utilize tailwind css styling.

<h3>Running the application</h3>
First <text>npm install</text> , this will install all dev dependencies.
If you don't have MongoDB installed, do so now.<br></br>
You will need to create a .env file at the root of the project to define the port where you will be running the application from, as well as a connection url for mongodb.<br></br>
There are three commands to use when running/developing your future application: <br></br>
  <ul>"npm run back" launches the backend server<br></ul>
  <ul>"npm run front" builds and watches the frontend files<br></ul>
  <ul>"npm run css" builds and watches css changes (tailwind)</ul>
