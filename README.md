# create-mern-app
Creates a fullstack application with a todo app template
This template uses MongoDB/Mongoose ODM for data persistence/querying, Express Framework on Node.js backend, and React frontend.
I've also included tailwind config to utilize tailwind css styling. Feel free to fork and clone to skip config on your next project!

<h3>Running the application</h3>
First <text>npm install</text> , this will install all dev dependencies.
If you don't have MongoDB installed, do so now.<br></br>
You will need to create a .env file at the root of the project to define the port where you will be running the application from, as well as a connection url for mongodb.<br></br>
There are three commands to use when running/developing your future application: <br></br>
  <ul>"npm run back" launches the backend server<br></ul>
  <ul>"npm run front" builds and watches the frontend files<br></ul>
  <ul>"npm run css" builds and watches css changes (tailwind)</ul>
